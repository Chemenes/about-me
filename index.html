 <h1>Hello!
    <p>I'm Chris, thank you for taking the time to review my page.</p>
    <p>I'm a recent transplant to Seattle via New Jersey.</p>
    <p>Collecting/making music, skateboading and exploring  is how i like to spend my time.</p>
    <p>My journey into learning programing is an exciting one and has become a new passion of mine.</p>
    <p>I'd like to someday utilize my skills to help change the face of how we learn.</p>
    <p>Thank you once again and have a great day!</p>
