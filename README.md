# about-me
This is a project to ask a user to ask questions about me!
For my about-me project I've started by giving the user an alert array prompt presenting a Yes or No game. This gives the user a fun introduction and challenge.

I then set a function to 0 and created a do loop.
Within that loop i set my if statement to a value of No(the correct answer to the question asked) and an alert to give the guest an alert of letting them know their answer is correct.

I then followed that formule with varing answers for the 5 questions asked for our lab.

For the 6th question, which is a guessing game set with a number value rather than yes or no, I started by creacting variables for the right answer, the counter and the maximum attempts a user will receive to answer.

I then created a while loop that states if the users answer is not equal to the right answer the return value will be the counter of zero and they have the maximum attempts to do so which is 4. I also created else and if statements that give right, wrong or tells the user to use a number value based on the guests answers.

For the 7th question I created a game where the guest can guest the 6 answers I've given to my question in 6 tries. I created a variables for the 6 possible answers, possible guests, attempts and a flag. I then created a do loop that asks the user to guest my choices and a string that converts all answers to lower case to invoke the answers to the question if asked correctly. If and do loops have been created for possible answers and alerts for the guest to inform them if their choices were correct or on correct.

Breaks were created for question 7 so that they wouldn't become infinite loops.

I made a bried introduction of myself followed by 10 questions to inform the user a little more information on myself. I added some color to the background and text through CSS.
